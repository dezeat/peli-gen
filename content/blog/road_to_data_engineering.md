Summary: A personal reflection on my journey into data engineering, from early tech curiosity to cloud-based data work.

I started this blog as a place to document what I'm learning and building — a personal knowledge base that helps me think, and occasionally something I can point others to.  
This post is a short overview of how I ended up in data engineering, even though I didn't follow the classic computer science route.

## Early curiosity for computers

I grew up with computers, games, and the early web — the kind of environment where you naturally learn how things work by experimenting and spending way too many hours in front of a screen.

When I was around thirteen, a friend showed me how to build a PC. We put together a gaming tower at his place, and for the first time I actually understood — by touching the parts — what a CPU is, what RAM does, what a network card and hard drive look like and how they fit together. That hands-on moment stuck with me.

Between twelve and eighteen, I spent a huge amount of time at the computer: gaming, tinkering, just being online. I took an HTML course at school and tried out bits and pieces on my own, but I was never the script kiddie type. I did have friends who were, though — and I loved listening to them. I could spend hours hearing them talk about what they were building or breaking, and I always found it fascinating to learn from them. I wasn't the one writing scripts, but I was very curious about how it all worked.

## First technical foundations

Before moving into the social sciences, I briefly studied Cognitive Science.  
There, I took Computer Science I & II, covering algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming in Java. Even though I didn't continue the program, these were the first structured programming concepts I ever learned — and they stayed with me.

## Academic path: quantitative, not purely technical

I eventually moved into political science, but always gravitated toward the quantitative side.  
My bachelor's and master's work focused on statistics, empirical methods, and R. I designed experiments, modeled survey data, and did data-analyses for my scientific work and thesis — essentially learning how to think with data long before I worked with it in production systems.

## First practical step: applied data work

My real entry point into tech didn't come through a computer science degree, but through a student job during the pandemic.  
I worked in a data-heavy marketing environment: dashboards, SQL, automation, R scripts, and small workflow optimizations. It was hands-on and it made me realize that working at the intersection of data, tooling, and infrastructure is exactly what interests me.

## Growing into data engineering

After university, I stepped into my first full-time role as a junior data developer.  
There I worked with SQL, Python, Airflow, cloud tooling, and version control — effectively learning the foundations of building and maintaining data pipelines. I spent a lot of time learning after work: reading, experimenting, taking cloud certifications, and building up software-engineering habits.  

## Today: working on a cloud-based data platform

Now I work as a Data Engineer in the energy sector, in a team that builds and operates a cloud-based data platform using Azure, Databricks, Python, and PySpark.

My day-to-day work is fairly end-to-end: gathering requirements, writing data models, embedding them into our internal framework, deploying, orchestrating, and maintaining pipelines. I'm one of two data engineers on the team, and I co-maintain and develop our PySpark-based data engineering framework.

I've been in this role since summer 2024, and while I can handle most tasks on my own by now, I'm still learning a lot — especially when it comes to architecture decisions and deeper system design. It's a good environment to grow in: I'm surrounded by experienced engineers, and this is also where I really got hands-on with software engineering best practices — a solid test suite, CI/CD automation, and a well-structured, modular codebase. There's always something to pick up, and I'm steadily getting more confident in the work.

## Why this blog

This blog is a place to:

- collect notes about what I'm experimenting with
- document small projects
- reflect on patterns in data engineering
- write about tools, design ideas, and things I want to understand more deeply

I also just enjoy writing — structuring my thoughts, putting them into words, and making sense of what I'm learning along the way. Maybe that's partly because I didn't come from a traditional CS background: writing has always been part of how I learn and process things.
