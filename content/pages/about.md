Slug: about

I'm a Data Engineer based in Hamburg, working on cloud-based data platforms with Azure, Databricks, Python, and PySpark. My day-to-day involves building pipelines end-to-end — from requirements to deployment — and co-maintaining an internal data engineering framework with my team.

I didn't take the classic CS route. I studied political science with a focus on quantitative methods, worked a data-heavy student job during the pandemic, and gradually moved into engineering from there. I learned by doing: building things, breaking things, reading a lot after work, and picking up software engineering habits along the way.

What got me here was curiosity. I've been fascinated by computers and the internet since I was a kid — building my first PC at thirteen, spending way too many hours online, and always wanting to understand how things work under the hood. That curiosity is still what drives me today.

This site is where I write down what I'm learning, document small projects, and reflect on patterns in data engineering. Writing helps me structure my thoughts — maybe that's the social science background showing. If you're into data engineering, cloud platforms, or just figuring things out as you go, feel free to look around.
