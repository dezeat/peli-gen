Slug: about



I’m a self-taught Data Engineer based in Hamburg. I’ve spent the last few years working on data ingestion, modeling, and internal tooling across different cloud environments. I like understanding how systems behave, how data moves, and how all the pieces connect.

Even before AI became the big thing, I was already interested in the intersection of computer science, data, cloud, and the wider internet economy. That curiosity is what pushed me into engineering in the first place, and it still drives how I learn and work today.

I didn’t study CS; I learned by doing, experimenting, breaking things, and asking a lot of questions. My approach is simple: stay curious, dig into problems, and try to actually understand what’s going on under the hood.

This site is where I write down what I learn, explore topics across the stack, and document small projects. If you’re into data engineering, backend systems, or just the broader tech world, feel free to look around.
