Slug: about

I have been working in the industry since 2022, currently focusing on cloud-based data platforms using Azure, Databricks, Python, and PySpark. My day-to-day involves building end-to-end pipelines—from requirements to deployment—and co-maintaining an internal data engineering framework with my team.

I didn't take the classic Computer Science route. I studied Political Science with a focus on quantitative methods, worked a data-heavy student job during the pandemic, and gradually moved into engineering from there.

I learned by doing: building systems, debugging, and consistently closing the knowledge gap between where I am and where I need to be. I believe that practical experience—backed by a willingness to learn the fundamentals—is often the best teacher.

This is where I document what I'm learning, archive small projects, and reflect on patterns in data engineering. If you're into data engineering, cloud platforms, or just figuring things out as you go, feel free to look around.
