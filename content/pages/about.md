## Hi, I'm dezeat
I'm a **Data Engineer** with 3 years of experience building robust data pipelines and infrastructure. While my expertise lies in backend data systems, I'm currently expanding my skills into frontend development to become a more well-rounded engineer.

### What I Do

My day-to-day work involves:

- Designing and implementing scalable data pipelines
- Building ETL/ELT processes for large-scale data processing
- Working with tools like Apache Spark, Airflow, and various cloud platforms
- Optimizing database performance and data warehousing solutions
- Collaborating with data scientists and analysts to deliver actionable insights

### Why This Blog?

I created this blog to document my learning journey, particularly as I venture into frontend development. As someone who's spent years in the backend world, I'm excited to share:

- Data engineering best practices and lessons learned
- My experiences learning frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Tutorials and guides that would have helped me when I was starting out
- Project showcases and technical deep-dives

### Current Focus

Right now, I'm working on:

- Mastering modern web development fundamentals
- Building this blog using Pelican (static site generator)
- Exploring how frontend and backend technologies work together
- Documenting everything I learn along the way

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers, especially those working in data engineering or making similar career transitions. Feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/pages/contact.html) or find me on GitHub.

Thanks for stopping by!
